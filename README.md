# Javascript Framework Course Assignment

Javascript Framework Course Assignment is an E-Com online store where users can browse and search for a wide variety of different items. It's made using a combination of React and Bootstrap, though the latter is rather clunky. The project is set up using Vite to optimize the build process.

## Description

The Javascript Framework Course Assignment is an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse and search for a wide range of items. The site features various categories and a search functionality to help users find products quickly and efficiently. Despite being built with Bootstrap, which I found to be quite clunky, the project demonstrates essential e-commerce functionalities such as product listings, detailed product views, and a user-friendly interface.

React powers the dynamic and responsive components of the site, ensuring a seamless browsing experience. The application is styled using Bootstrap, though it has its limitations in terms of flexibility and design aesthetics. Vite is used to streamline the development process, offering fast builds and a smooth development experience. This project was a significant learning experience, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the chosen technologies.
